# AudioSignalRobot

## Utilized TI RSLK MAX KIT and TI MSP432P401R LaunchPad, created a PCB circuit that would have the microphones soldered to detect audio signals. Programmed a bandpass filter of 200Hz-3000Hz. Samples the audio signals and calculates how to determine what action of movement to perform until reaching the location of the audio signal.
